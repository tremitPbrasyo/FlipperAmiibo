# Grundig Modul 839: A Vintage Stereo Amplifier with a Unique Serial Number
  
If you are a fan of vintage audio equipment, you may have heard of Grundig Modul 839, a stereo amplifier that was produced in Germany in the late 1970s. This amplifier was part of the Grundig Hi-Fi Studio series, which also included a tuner, a cassette deck, and a turntable. The Modul 839 was designed to deliver high-quality sound with low distortion and noise, and featured a metal case, a wooden front panel, and a large VU meter.

However, what makes this amplifier even more interesting is that it has a unique serial number: fa115722110253. This number is not just a random combination of digits, but actually has a meaning behind it. According to some sources[^3^], the first two letters (fa) stand for "Fertigungsauftrag", which means "production order" in German. The next six digits (115722) indicate the date of production: November 5th, 1972. The last six digits (110253) are the serial number of the unit within that production order.
  
This means that this particular amplifier was one of the earliest models of the Modul 839, and probably one of the few that still exist today. It is a rare and valuable piece of audio history, and a collector's item for anyone who appreciates vintage sound. If you are interested in acquiring this amplifier, you can find it on some online platforms[^1^] [^2^], but be prepared to pay a high price for it.
